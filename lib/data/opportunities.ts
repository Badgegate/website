- Troubleshoot and diagnose complex issues within the Kubernetes environment.
- Collaborate extensively with development teams to establish and implement DevOps best practices for secure and efficient deployments.
- Continuously innovate and automate DevOps workflows to streamline processes.
- Stay at the forefront of advancements in Kubernetes, CI/CD tools, monitoring technologies, and the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology.
- Proactively identify and implement industry-leading security best practices to safeguard our infrastructure.
- Mentor engineers and share your vast knowledge of blockchain technology and DevOps principles.


### Qualifications
- 10+ years of related professional experience
- Proven track record of successfully designing, implementing, and managing large-scale, production-grade Kubernetes deployments.
- In-depth and demonstrable expertise in CI/CD principles and a variety of tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, etc.).
- Mastery of PromQL for querying and analyzing complex monitoring data, particularly from blockchain systems.
- Strong understanding of cloud platforms (AWS, Cloudflare).
- Excellent scripting skills (Bash, Python, etc.) and experience with infrastructure as code tools (e.g., Terraform).
- A deep understanding distributed systems, and their security considerations is crucial.
- Prior experience working with blockchain technologies is a plus.
- Exceptional communication, collaboration, and leadership skills.
- Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, innovative environment and work effectively as part of a talented team.

### About DFINITY and the Internet Computer:

The Internet Computer is the fastest and only infinitely scalable general-purpose blockchain — incubated and launched by the DFINITY Foundation in May 2021. A team of over 200 world-renowned cryptographers, distributed systems engineers, and programming language experts have taken on the massive technological challenge of building, maintaining, and continuously improving a ‘world computer’ powerful enough to host Web3 dApps, DeFi, games, NFTs, social media, and metaverse projects.

DFINITY was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur and crypto theoretician, Dominic Williams, and attracted interest and financial contributions from early members of the Ethereum community. Later, top-tier institutions such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and SV Angel backed the Internet Computer in a collective effort to help build out Web3.
